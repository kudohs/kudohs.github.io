Lord, I pray that I could say encouragements after 6 PM.
  

Focus/Target/Goal:  Salesforce / Disney / Kaiser / Scorpion (SCV)     
(1) AWS Cloud Engineer who could teach Python and Mulesoft (2) Bassist

Realistic Goals: 
1) AWS - get SAA cert by 12/1/2019
   Action Step (Udemy - M-F: 12:15-1:15 pm, 5-5:30 am, 8-8:15 am)

2) Python - Upload py codes in Github after Corey Shafer's classes (done 2 time)
   Action Step (M-F: 30 min RR, 30 min (4:30-5 AM), 30 min (5:30 - 6 PM))

3) Become certified "MuleSoft Certified Developer â€“ Level 1" by 12/1/2019
   Action Step (M-F: 5:30 - 6 pm, Trailheads)

4) Kudohs.com Time - Educating Python (how??)
   Youtube channels - generates $$


General Direction: AWS Cert must, Python code must, Mulesoft (Salesforce) remote job must

What do I get out of AB/Contribute to AB:

- Python coding whole lot

- Automate process with Python

- Possibly more Salesforce integration skills thru Trailheads
