Lord, I pray that I could say encouragements after 7:30 PM today.

Lord, I ask for you to open the opportunity for me to go forward to enlarge the kingdom.
Lord, I ask you "what do you want me to do?"
How do I do what I am good at and also make money to pay debts?
  
  
Focus/Target/Goal:  Salesforce / Disney / Scorpion (SCV)     
(1) Python Expert who knows AWS (2) Bassist

Three Pillars
1) Python (25%)
2) Pandas (25%)
3) AWS (25%)
4) Apache Spark (25%)

Realistic Goals: 
1) Get Apache Spark cert by 12/1/2019
   Action Step (Weekend Focus, side job)

2) Python - Upload py codes in Github after Corey Shafer's classes (done 2 time)
   Action Step (M-F: 30 min RR, 50 min (12:25 - 1:15 PM))

4) Kudohs.com - Python coding teach

General Direction: Spark Cert must, Python code must, remote job must

- Python coding whole lot

- Automate process with Python using Pandas as well
