Lord, I pray that I could say encouragements after 5:45 PM.
  

Focus/Target/Goal:  Salesforce / Disney / Kaiser / Scorpion (SCV)     
(1) Certified AWS Cloud Engineer who could code and teach Python (2) Bassist

Three Pillars
1) AWS
2) Pandas
3) Python 
4) Salesforce Process Automation

Realistic Goals: 
1) AWS - get SAA cert by 12/1/2019
   Action Step (Udemy - M-F: 12:15-1:15 pm, 5-5:30 am, 8-8:15 am)

2) Python - Upload py codes in Github after Corey Shafer's classes (done 2 time)
   Action Step (M-F: 30 min RR, 30 min (4:30-5 AM), 30 min (5:30 - 6 PM))

3) Comfortable with SF Process Automation

4) Kudohs.com Time - Educating Pandas 
   Youtube channels - generates $$


General Direction: AWS Cert must, Python code must, Mulesoft (Salesforce) remote job must

What do I get out of AB/Contribute to AB:

- Python coding whole lot

- Automate process with Python using Pandas as well

- Possibly more Salesforce integration skills thru Trailheads
